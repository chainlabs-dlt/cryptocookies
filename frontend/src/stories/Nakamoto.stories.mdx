# Nakamoto's Storybook

## Usage

Here you will find an isolated view of the components designed for the project. It will help you take a look at the
different existing components and their API (the props that can be passed to the components) and see interractive versions
for sandboxing purposes.

### How to use it ?

#### How to use the storybook :

Each component is defined in a file with the `.stories.tsx` extension. You can find the different components in the
`src/stories` folder. These files are examples of how to use the components. You can also see the different props that
can be passed to the components in their respective story pages, and dynamically change them to see how they affect the component.

#### Pages :

-   **GUI** : Contains all the components that are useful for the graphical user interface.
-   **3D** : Contains all the components that are useful for the 3D scene.

### How to create the app ?

To start creating the app, you will first need to put the scene in the main component, and then add the different components of the GUI on top of it.
You can have an example of this in the `src/App.tsx` file. This scene's props enables you to pass callbacks and values for the interractable 3D elements.
To connect the GUI and the scene, you will need to use hooks that will change the display of the GUI depending on actions on the scene.

For the 3D part, some elements can still be customized, like the `OrbitControls` that enables the user to move the camera around the scene (it can
restrict some movements - like panning - to avoid the user to go out of the scene). You can also change the `camera` position and the `light` position.

### Known issues

-   From what I have seen in development environment, some changes to the code make the pump glass turn dark. Refreshing the page fixes the issue.
-   The leaves of the ground highly extends the build time, for now I have commented them out to avoid this issue in development.
